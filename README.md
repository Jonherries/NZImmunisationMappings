# NZImmunisationMappings
This describes mappings between CDC immunisation codes, the codes used in New Zealand and the need to create extensions to this for consumers

This takes information from the CDC (CVX codes):

https://www2a.cdc.gov/vaccines/iis/iisstandards/vaccines.asp?rpt=vg

Maps them to our NZ codes used in the National Immunisation Register

https://www.health.govt.nz/our-work/preventative-health-wellness/immunisation/national-immunisation-register

and adds codes from GP systems sourced from Conporto (Dr Info) www.drinfo.co.nz 

We have then sourced and mapped information from http://immune.org.nz/ to add information for consumers.
