NIMENRIX works by causing your body to produce its own protection (or antibodies), against these types of meningococcal bacteria. NIMENRIX cannot cause meningococcal disease. The most common types of meningococcal disease are
meningitis (infection of a lining around the brain and spinal cord) and septicaemia (blood infection).  Neisseria bacteria can less commonly infect the joints, lungs or other organs.
Meningococcal disease is spread by small droplets from the nose, mouth or throat. Meningococcal disease is
generally serious and sometimes causes long-term effects (e.g. deafness, memory problems, loss of
fingers or toes), or death.
As with all vaccines, NIMENRIX may not protect all people who arevaccinated.
Also, NIMENRIX does not help to protect against meningococcal disease caused by other types of Neisseria, or meningitis caused by other bacteria or viruses. NIMENRIX can be used in infants from 6 weeks of age, children and
adults. NIMENRIX may also be prescribed for other people or situations.
If you are not sure whether you or your child should be given this vaccine, talk to your doctor.","Mild pain, redness and swelling around injection site

(whooping cough). The vaccine is sometimes called dTpa vaccine.
BOOSTRIX is intended for use in children aged 4 years and older and
adults.
Diphtheria, pertussis and tetanus are three life-threatening diseases caused by bacterial infection.
The vaccine works by causing the body to produce its own protection (antibodies) against the
disease.
Diphtheria
Diphtheria is a bacterium that lives in the airways of humans and can also affect the skin.
Generally, the airways become inflamed (swollen) causing severe breathing difficulties and
sometimes suffocation. The bacteria release a toxin (poison) which can cause nerve damage,
heart problems and death. The risk of serious complications and death is greater in the very young
and elderly.
Tetanus (Lockjaw)
Tetanus bacteria enter the body through wounded skin. Wounds that are especially prone to
infection are burn wounds, fractures, deep wounds or wounds contaminated with soil, dust, horse
manure or wood splinters. The bacteria release toxins, which can cause muscle stiffness, painful
spasms, fits and death. The spasm can be strong enough to cause bone fractures of the spine.
Pertussis (Whooping cough)
Pertussis is highly infectious. It affects the breathing tract causing severe spells of coughing
that may interfere with normal breathing. The coughing is often accompanied by a whooping
sound. The cough may last for 1-2 months or longer. Pertussis can also cause inner ear infections,
long lasting bronchitis, pneumonia, fits, brain damage and death. The risk of severe complications
and death is greatest in infants under 6 months of age.
Vaccination is the best way of protecting against these diseases. BOOSTRIX vaccine cannot give
you or your child diphtheria, tetanus or pertussis infection. The vaccine will not protect against
diseases caused by other types of bacteria or organisms.","Pain and swelling around the injection site may prevent normal everyday activities for 2448 hours

sometimes suffocation. The bacteria release a toxin (poison) which can cause nerve damage,
heart problems and death. The risk of serious complications and death is greater in the very young
and elderly.
Tetanus (Lockjaw)
Tetanus bacteria enter the body through wounded skin. Wounds that are especially prone to
infection are burn wounds, fractures, deep wounds or wounds contaminated with soil, dust, horse
manure or wood splinters. The bacteria release toxins, which can cause muscle stiffness, painful
spasms, fits and death. The spasm can be strong enough to cause bone fractures of the spine.
Pertussis (Whooping cough)
Pertussis is highly infectious. It affects the breathing tract causing severe spells of coughing
that may interfere with normal breathing. The coughing is often accompanied by a whooping
sound. The cough may last for 1-2 months or longer. Pertussis can also cause inner ear infections,
long lasting bronchitis, pneumonia, fits, brain damage and death. The risk of severe complications
and death is greatest in infants under 6 months of age.
Vaccination is the best way of protecting against these diseases. BOOSTRIX vaccine cannot give
you or your child diphtheria, tetanus or pertussis infection. The vaccine will not protect against
diseases caused by other types of bacteria or organisms.","Pain and swelling around the injection site may prevent normal everyday activities for 2448 hours

INFANRIX-IPV is not intended for use in adults.
Diphtheria, pertussis, tetanus and poliomyelitis are life-threatening diseases caused by bacterial and viral infections.
The vaccine works by causing the body to produce its own protection (antibodies) against these diseases.
Diphtheria
Diphtheria is a bacterium that lives in the airways of humans and can also affect the skin. Generally, the airways
become inflamed (swollen) causing severe breathing difficulties and sometimes suffocation. The bacteria release a
toxin (poison) which can cause nerve damage, heart problems and death. The risk of serious complications and death is
greater in the very young and elderly.
Tetanus (Lockjaw)
Tetanus bacteria enter the body through wounded skin. Wounds that are especially prone to infection are burn wounds,
fractures, deep wounds or wounds contaminated with soil, dust, horse manure or wood splinters. The bacteria release
toxins, which can cause muscle stiffness, painful spasms, fits and death. The spasm can be strong enough to cause bone
fractures of the spine.
Pertussis (Whooping cough)
Pertussis is highly infectious. It affects the breathing tract causing severe spells of coughing that may interfere with
normal breathing. The coughing is often accompanied by a whooping sound. The cough may last for 1-2 months or
longer. Pertussis can also cause inner ear infections, long lasting bronchitis, pneumonia, fits, brain damage and death.
The risk of severe complications and death is greatest in infants under 6 months of age.
Poliomyelitis (Polio)
There are various types of poliovirus (types I, II and III) that cause poliomyelitis. The virus infects the bowel, and from
there can attack the nervous system causing meningitis or paralysis.Infection may be without symptoms or with only
minor bowel upset. When infection spreads to the nervous system, it can cause paralysis. Incubation for poliomyelitis is
commonly 7 to 14 days in severe cases and ranges from 3 to 35 days. Infection is spread by mouth and faeces.
Vaccination is the best way of protecting against these diseases. INFANRIX-IPV vaccine cannot give a child
diphtheria, tetanus, pertussis infection or poliomyelitis. The vaccine will not protect against diseases caused by other
types of bacteria or organisms.","Mild pain, redness and swelling around injection site

poliomyelitis.
INFANRIX-IPV is not intended for use in adults.
Diphtheria, pertussis, tetanus and poliomyelitis are life-threatening diseases caused by bacterial and viral infections.
The vaccine works by causing the body to produce its own protection (antibodies) against these diseases.
Diphtheria
Diphtheria is a bacterium that lives in the airways of humans and can also affect the skin. Generally, the airways
become inflamed (swollen) causing severe breathing difficulties and sometimes suffocation. The bacteria release a
toxin (poison) which can cause nerve damage, heart problems and death. The risk of serious complications and death is
greater in the very young and elderly.
Tetanus (Lockjaw)
Tetanus bacteria enter the body through wounded skin. Wounds that are especially prone to infection are burn wounds,
fractures, deep wounds or wounds contaminated with soil, dust, horse manure or wood splinters. The bacteria release
toxins, which can cause muscle stiffness, painful spasms, fits and death. The spasm can be strong enough to cause bone
fractures of the spine.
Pertussis (Whooping cough)
Pertussis is highly infectious. It affects the breathing tract causing severe spells of coughing that may interfere with
normal breathing. The coughing is often accompanied by a whooping sound. The cough may last for 1-2 months or
longer. Pertussis can also cause inner ear infections, long lasting bronchitis, pneumonia, fits, brain damage and death.
The risk of severe complications and death is greatest in infants under 6 months of age.
Poliomyelitis (Polio)
There are various types of poliovirus (types I, II and III) that cause poliomyelitis. The virus infects the bowel, and from
there can attack the nervous system causing meningitis or paralysis.Infection may be without symptoms or with only
minor bowel upset. When infection spreads to the nervous system, it can cause paralysis. Incubation for poliomyelitis is
commonly 7 to 14 days in severe cases and ranges from 3 to 35 days. Infection is spread by mouth and faeces.
Vaccination is the best way of protecting against these diseases. INFANRIX-IPV vaccine cannot give a child
diphtheria, tetanus, pertussis infection or poliomyelitis. The vaccine will not protect against diseases caused by other
types of bacteria or organisms.","Mild pain, redness and swelling around injection site

NeisVac-C will only protect against invasive disease caused by the meningococci group C bacteria. It will not protect against other groups of meningococci or other organisms that cause meningitis and blood poisoning.

CVX,30,,,HBIG,,,1 to 99,6,,,Hepatitis B,Protects against hepatitis B.,"HBvaxPRO is a vaccine used to help prevent hepatitis B. The vaccine can be given to newborns, infants, children, teenagers and adults. Hepatitis B is an infection of the liver caused by the hepatitis B virus (HBV). It can be caught by coming into contact with an infected persons blood, semen, vaginal secretions, saliva or other body fluids. For example, if these infected fluids enter your blood stream through a cut in your skin, you could become infected. Other situations that could lead to infection include:
 being born to a mother who carries the HBV
 sexual contact with someone who is infected
 living in the same house as someone who is infected
 close family contact, for example, sharing razors or toothbrushes
 having a job that involves exposure to human blood or body fluids, for example, some health care workers
 sharing needles for injecting drugs
 travelling to areas where hepatitis B is common
People who have hepatitis B may not look or feel sick when infected. In fact, a person could be infected by the virus six weeks to six months before symptoms occur. Some people develop mild, flu-like symptoms. Others may become very ill and extremely tired, develop yellowing of the skin and/or eyes (also called jaundice), dark urine and other symptoms that require hospitalisation. Most people recover completely from the HBV infection. However, there are some people, particularly children, who may not have symptoms but continue to carry the virus in their blood. They are called chronic carriers. These chronic carriers are infectious and can spread the disease to others throughout their lives. Babies who are infected with the HBV at birth, almost always go on to become chronic carriers. The infection at birth is silent, and the babies appear healthy and continue to remain healthy for many years. However, after 30, 40 or 50 years they can become unwell and develop the symptoms described above. All chronic carriers run the risk of developing serious liver disease, such as cirrhosis (scarring of the liver) or liver cancer. There is no specific treatment for hepatitis B. Therefore, vaccination is the best way to help protect against infection and possible serious long-term disease. HBvaxPRO works by causing your body to produce its own protection by making diseasefighting substances (antibodies) to fight the HBV. If a vaccinated person comes into contact with HBV, the body is usually ready, and produces antibodies to destroy the virus.
However, as with all vaccines, 100% protection against hepatitis B cannot be guaranteed. Because hepatitis B infection can go undetected for a long period of time, it is possible that an individual may already be infected at the time the vaccine is given. The vaccine may not prevent hepatitis B in these individuals. HBvaxPRO will not protect against hepatitis caused by other agents or viruses (such as hepatitis A, hepatitis C, hepatitis D, hepatitis E).","Mild pain, redness and swelling around injection site

protection (antibodies) against this disease.
Hepatitis B is an infectious disease, which can affect the liver. This disease is caused by the hepatitis B virus.
The hepatitis B virus is found in body fluids such as blood, semen, vaginal secretions or saliva of infected people. You
can catch the virus if it enters your bloodstream. Ways this can happen are through:
 injection (eg needlestick injury, or sharing needles for IV drug use)
 sexual intercourse
 sores, cuts or tiny wounds coming into contact with infected fluids (eg from a human bite, sharing razors or
toothbrushes, or working with human blood or body fluids)
 an infected mother passing the virus onto her baby during or shortly after birth.
Some people infected with hepatitis B may not look or feel sick yet others will get symptoms. Symptoms may not appear
for 6 weeks to 6 months after infection. Sometimes people will only have mild flu-like symptoms, but other people can
become very ill. They may be extremely tired, and have dark urine, pale faeces, yellowish skin and/or eyes (jaundice),
and may need to be admitted to hospital. There is a risk of serious liver disease, such as cirrhosis (liver scarring) and liver
cancer for all chronic hepatitis B carriers.
Some groups of people are at a higher risk of exposure to hepatitis B. Vaccination is recommended for these people:
 some healthcare workers
 abusers of injectable drugs
 people with many sexual partners
 homosexual men
 haemodialysis patients or people who receive certain blood products
 people with chronic liver disease or hepatitis C
 people in contact with a hepatitis B carrier or an infected person
 staff and residents of institutions or homes
 inmates and prison staff at some correctional institutions
 some travellers to areas where the incidence of hepatitis B is high
Vaccination is the best way to protect against infection in the longer term. It may also help reduce disease complications
such as chronic active hepatitis and liver cirrhosis as well as incidence of a type of liver cancer known as primary
hepatocellular carcinoma.

 injection (eg needlestick injury, or sharing needles for IV drug use)
 sexual intercourse
 sores, cuts or tiny wounds coming into contact with infected fluids (eg from a human bite, sharing razors or
toothbrushes, or working with human blood or body fluids)
 an infected mother passing the virus onto her baby during or shortly after birth.
Some people infected with hepatitis B may not look or feel sick yet others will get symptoms. Symptoms may not appear
for 6 weeks to 6 months after infection. Sometimes people will only have mild flu-like symptoms, but other people can
become very ill. They may be extremely tired, and have dark urine, pale faeces, yellowish skin and/or eyes (jaundice),
and may need to be admitted to hospital. There is a risk of serious liver disease, such as cirrhosis (liver scarring) and liver
cancer for all chronic hepatitis B carriers.
Some groups of people are at a higher risk of exposure to hepatitis B. Vaccination is recommended for these people:
 some healthcare workers
 abusers of injectable drugs
 people with many sexual partners
 homosexual men
 haemodialysis patients or people who receive certain blood products
 people with chronic liver disease or hepatitis C
 people in contact with a hepatitis B carrier or an infected person
 staff and residents of institutions or homes
 inmates and prison staff at some correctional institutions
 some travellers to areas where the incidence of hepatitis B is high
Vaccination is the best way to protect against infection in the longer term. It may also help reduce disease complications
such as chronic active hepatitis and liver cirrhosis as well as incidence of a type of liver cancer known as primary
hepatocellular carcinoma.

protection (antibodies) against this disease.
Hepatitis B is an infectious disease, which can affect the liver. This disease is caused by the hepatitis B virus.
The hepatitis B virus is found in body fluids such as blood, semen, vaginal secretions or saliva of infected people. You
can catch the virus if it enters your bloodstream. Ways this can happen are through:
 injection (eg needlestick injury, or sharing needles for IV drug use)
 sexual intercourse
 sores, cuts or tiny wounds coming into contact with infected fluids (eg from a human bite, sharing razors or
toothbrushes, or working with human blood or body fluids)
 an infected mother passing the virus onto her baby during or shortly after birth.
Some people infected with hepatitis B may not look or feel sick yet others will get symptoms. Symptoms may not appear
for 6 weeks to 6 months after infection. Sometimes people will only have mild flu-like symptoms, but other people can
become very ill. They may be extremely tired, and have dark urine, pale faeces, yellowish skin and/or eyes (jaundice),
and may need to be admitted to hospital. There is a risk of serious liver disease, such as cirrhosis (liver scarring) and liver
cancer for all chronic hepatitis B carriers.
Some groups of people are at a higher risk of exposure to hepatitis B. Vaccination is recommended for these people:
 some healthcare workers
 abusers of injectable drugs
 people with many sexual partners
 homosexual men
 haemodialysis patients or people who receive certain blood products
 people with chronic liver disease or hepatitis C
 people in contact with a hepatitis B carrier or an infected person
 staff and residents of institutions or homes
 inmates and prison staff at some correctional institutions
 some travellers to areas where the incidence of hepatitis B is high
Vaccination is the best way to protect against infection in the longer term. It may also help reduce disease complications
such as chronic active hepatitis and liver cirrhosis as well as incidence of a type of liver cancer known as primary
hepatocellular carcinoma.

GP Codes,ConsegnaTest,,"HepB, paed-3 5m","HepB, paed-3 5m",,,,,,,Hepatitis B,Protects against hepatitis B.,"ENGERIX-B is a vaccine used to prevent hepatitis B infection. The vaccine works by aiding the body to produce its own
protection (antibodies) against this disease.
Hepatitis B is an infectious disease, which can affect the liver. This disease is caused by the hepatitis B virus.
The hepatitis B virus is found in body fluids such as blood, semen, vaginal secretions or saliva of infected people. You
can catch the virus if it enters your bloodstream. Ways this can happen are through:
 injection (eg needlestick injury, or sharing needles for IV drug use)
 sexual intercourse
 sores, cuts or tiny wounds coming into contact with infected fluids (eg from a human bite, sharing razors or
toothbrushes, or working with human blood or body fluids)
 an infected mother passing the virus onto her baby during or shortly after birth.
Some people infected with hepatitis B may not look or feel sick yet others will get symptoms. Symptoms may not appear
for 6 weeks to 6 months after infection. Sometimes people will only have mild flu-like symptoms, but other people can
become very ill. They may be extremely tired, and have dark urine, pale faeces, yellowish skin and/or eyes (jaundice),
and may need to be admitted to hospital. There is a risk of serious liver disease, such as cirrhosis (liver scarring) and liver
cancer for all chronic hepatitis B carriers.
Some groups of people are at a higher risk of exposure to hepatitis B. Vaccination is recommended for these people:
 some healthcare workers
 abusers of injectable drugs
 people with many sexual partners
 homosexual men
 haemodialysis patients or people who receive certain blood products
 people with chronic liver disease or hepatitis C
 people in contact with a hepatitis B carrier or an infected person
 staff and residents of institutions or homes
 inmates and prison staff at some correctional institutions
 some travellers to areas where the incidence of hepatitis B is high
Vaccination is the best way to protect against infection in the longer term. It may also help reduce disease complications
such as chronic active hepatitis and liver cirrhosis as well as incidence of a type of liver cancer known as primary
hepatocellular carcinoma.

Immunoglobulin protects you from hepatitis B straight away but is only effective for a short time (8-12 weeks).
ENGERIX-B will not protect against hepatitis caused by other agents or viruses (such as hepatitis A, hepatitis C or
hepatitis E). As with all vaccines, not everyone who is vaccinated will be protected from getting the infection. If a person
is already infected with the hepatitis B virus at the time of vaccination, ENGERIX-B may not prevent the disease in these
people.","Mild pain, redness and swelling around injection site

CVX,165,,,HPV9,Active,HPV,,,137,HPV,Human Papilloma Virus (HPV),Protects against nine types of human papillomavirus.,"GARDASIL 9 is a vaccine that helps protect against disease caused by the following types of Human Papillomavirus (HPV): 6,11,16,18,31,33,45,52 and 58.
In girls and women 9 through 45 years of age, it helps prevent: 
? cervical (the lower end of the uterus or womb), vulvar (the outside of the female genitals), vaginal, and anal cancers
? abnormal and precancerous (changes in cells which have a risk of turning into cancer) cervical, vaginal, vulvar and anal lesions
? genital warts and
? HPV infection
In boys and men 9 through 26 years of age, GARDASIL 9 helps prevent
? Anal cancer and precancerous anal lesions
? External genital lesions, including genital warts and
? HPV infection
GARDASIL 9, helps prevent, but does not treat these diseases.
You cannot get HPV or any of these diseases from GARDASIL 9.
What is Human Papillomavirus?
HPV is a common virus. Of the many different types of HPV, some are harmless and others can cause diseases of the genital areas. While most people clear the virus, those who do not can develop disease, including cervical cancer, some vaginal, vulval and anal cancers and genital warts.
Who is at risk for HPV and why is vaccination with GARDASIL 9 important?
Without vaccination, it is estimated that the majority of people who have ever had sex will become infected with HPV
during their lifetime. A male or female of any age who has taken part in any kind of sexual activity that involves genital contact is at risk.
Most people who have HPV may not show any signs or symptoms.
This means that they can pass on the virus to others without knowing it.
What are cervical cancer and precancerous lesions?
Cancer of the cervix is a serious and sometimes life-threatening disease. It begins when a female catches certain types of HPV.
These HPV types can cause the cells in the lining of the cervix to change from normal to abnormal or precancerous lesions. These lesions are usually detected through the cervical screening program. If these lesions are not treated, they can turn cancerous. You or your child cannot get cervical cancer without first having a HPV infection.
What are vulvar and vaginal cancers?
Many vulvar and vaginal cancers are caused by HPV. There are no routine screening tests for these cancers.
What are anal cancer and precancerous lesions? HPV infection is strongly linked to anal cancer and pre-cancerous anal
lesions. There are no routine screening tests for anal cancer.
What are genital warts?
Genital warts are caused by certain types of HPV. They commonly appear as skincoloured, irregular growths. They
are found on the inside or outside of the genitals in both males and females. They can hurt, itch, bleed, and cause discomfort.
Sometimes they can come back after treatment. GARDASIL 9 only protects against diseases caused by the nine types covered by the vaccine. GARDASIL 9 works best when given before you or your child has become infected with HPV, but may also be of benefit if you or your child have had a previous infection. Talk with your doctor or pharmacist for more information.
The GARDASIL 9 vaccine:
? does not remove the need for cervical cancer screening; women should still get routine cervical cancer screening
? does not protect against disease that is caused by other types of HPV, otherviruses or bacteria
? does not protect you or your child from HPV types that you may already have (but most people do not have all types contained in the vaccine).","Fainting  more common in adolescent girls.

CVX,165,,,HPV9 ,,,1 to 99 ,5,,HPV,Human Papilloma Virus (HPV),Protects against nine types of human papillomavirus.,"GARDASIL 9 is a vaccine that helps protect against disease caused by the following types of Human Papillomavirus (HPV): 6,11,16,18,31,33,45,52 and 58.
In girls and women 9 through 45 years of age, it helps prevent: 
? cervical (the lower end of the uterus or womb), vulvar (the outside of the female genitals), vaginal, and anal cancers
? abnormal and precancerous (changes in cells which have a risk of turning into cancer) cervical, vaginal, vulvar and anal lesions
? genital warts and
? HPV infection
In boys and men 9 through 26 years of age, GARDASIL 9 helps prevent
? Anal cancer and precancerous anal lesions
? External genital lesions, including genital warts and
? HPV infection
GARDASIL 9, helps prevent, but does not treat these diseases.
You cannot get HPV or any of these diseases from GARDASIL 9.
What is Human Papillomavirus?
HPV is a common virus. Of the many different types of HPV, some are harmless and others can cause diseases of the genital areas. While most people clear the virus, those who do not can develop disease, including cervical cancer, some vaginal, vulval and anal cancers and genital warts.
Who is at risk for HPV and why is vaccination with GARDASIL 9 important?
Without vaccination, it is estimated that the majority of people who have ever had sex will become infected with HPV
during their lifetime. A male or female of any age who has taken part in any kind of sexual activity that involves genital contact is at risk.
Most people who have HPV may not show any signs or symptoms.
This means that they can pass on the virus to others without knowing it.
What are cervical cancer and precancerous lesions?
Cancer of the cervix is a serious and sometimes life-threatening disease. It begins when a female catches certain types of HPV.
These HPV types can cause the cells in the lining of the cervix to change from normal to abnormal or precancerous lesions. These lesions are usually detected through the cervical screening program. If these lesions are not treated, they can turn cancerous. You or your child cannot get cervical cancer without first having a HPV infection.
What are vulvar and vaginal cancers?
Many vulvar and vaginal cancers are caused by HPV. There are no routine screening tests for these cancers.
What are anal cancer and precancerous lesions? HPV infection is strongly linked to anal cancer and pre-cancerous anal
lesions. There are no routine screening tests for anal cancer.

The vaccine should be given before the influenza season in New Zealand.

The World Health Organization monitors influenza illness throughout the year and make recommendations on which three influenza types are likely to cause the most illness in the northern and in the southern hemisphere during their respective influenza seasons. Vaccine ingredients are specific to the brand of influenza vaccine they are associated with and may vary to year. Specific information on ingredients in the vaccines use each season can be found on the individual vaccine datasheets.

Influenza immunisation is recommended and offered free to:

Pregnant women (any trimester)
People aged 65 years or older
People aged under 65 years with a medical condition that increases their risk of developing complications from influenza, and the condition is specified in the Influenza Immunisation Programme eligibility criteria.
Children aged 4 years or under who have been hospitalised for respiratory illness or who have a history of significant respiratory illness.

NeisVac-C is used to prevent invasive disease caused by bacteria called Neisseria meningitidis group C.

The Neisseria meningitidis bacteria can cause serious and sometimes life-threatening infections such as meningitis and septicaemia (blood poisoning). NeisVac-C will only protect against invasive disease caused by the meningococci group C bacteria. It will not protect against other groups of meningococci or other organisms that cause meningitis and blood poisoning.

When a person is given NeisVac-C, the immune system (the bodys natural defense system) will produce its own protection (antibodies) against disease.

Your body usually takes several weeks after vaccination to develop protection against invasive meningococcal disease. Most people will produce enough antibodies to protect them against invasive meningococcal disease. However, as with all vaccines, 100% protection cannot be guaranteed.

NeisVac-C will not give you or your child meningococcal disease.

The chance of a severe reaction from NeisVac-C is very small, but the risks of not being vaccinated against invasive meningococcal disease may be very serious.

(antibodies) against these diseases.
Measles
Measles is a highly infectious viral
illness. Measles is spread by small
droplets from the nose, throat or
mouth of an infected person (often
before it is obvious they have
measles). Measles often begins with
a fever, runny nose, hacking cough
and conjunctivitis (eye
inflammation). The rash appears 3-5
days after the onset of symptoms and
spreads rapidly all over the body.
Measles is often a severe disease
complicated by ear infection and
pneumonia (lung infection).
Encephalitis (swelling of the brain)
can also occur and can sometimes
result in permanent brain damage or
death.

Mumps
Mumps is an infectious viral disease
spread by infected droplets of saliva.
Symptoms often begin with chilly
sensations, headache, loss of
appetite, general unwellness and
fever. The salivary glands on one or
both sides of the face can then
become very painful and swollen.
Complications include
meningoencephalitis (swelling
around the brain) and in older
patients the disease may involve
other organs e.g. testes in males.
Rubella (German measles)
Rubella is generally a mild infectious
viral illness spread by airborne
droplets. It can cause mild fever,
general unwellness, swollen glands
and mild red rash. It often goes
unnoticed in adolescents and adults.
However rubella can cause
miscarriage, stillbirth or birth defects
in infants born to mothers infected
with rubella during the early months
of pregnancy.

prevent three diseases, measles,
mumps and rubella (German
measles). The vaccine is sometimes
called MMR vaccine.
Measles, mumps and rubella are all
infectious diseases caused by viruses.
The vaccine works by causing the
body to produce its own protection
(antibodies) against these diseases.
Measles
Measles is a highly infectious viral
illness. Measles is spread by small
droplets from the nose, throat or
mouth of an infected person (often
before it is obvious they have
measles). Measles often begins with
a fever, runny nose, hacking cough
and conjunctivitis (eye
inflammation). The rash appears 3-5
days after the onset of symptoms and
spreads rapidly all over the body.
Measles is often a severe disease
complicated by ear infection and
pneumonia (lung infection).
Encephalitis (swelling of the brain)
can also occur and can sometimes
result in permanent brain damage or
death.
Unimmunised children in the
following groups are at particular
risk from severe measles infection:
 children with chronic conditions
such as cystic fibrosis, congenital
heart or kidney disease, failure to
thrive, Down's Syndrome
 children from the age of 1 year
upwards in child care centres,
family day care and playgroups
 children living in institutions
Mumps
Mumps is an infectious viral disease
spread by infected droplets of saliva.
Symptoms often begin with chilly
sensations, headache, loss of
appetite, general unwellness and
fever. The salivary glands on one or
both sides of the face can then
become very painful and swollen.
Complications include
meningoencephalitis (swelling
around the brain) and in older
patients the disease may involve
other organs e.g. testes in males.
Rubella (German measles)
Rubella is generally a mild infectious
viral illness spread by airborne
droplets. It can cause mild fever,
general unwellness, swollen glands
and mild red rash. It often goes
unnoticed in adolescents and adults.
However rubella can cause
miscarriage, stillbirth or birth defects
in infants born to mothers infected
with rubella during the early months
of pregnancy.

Vitamin B12 is needed to make new cells in the body such as red blood cells. A lack of vitamin B12 leads to anaemia, low energy, stomach problems (constipation, loss of appetite, weight loss), poor memory and nerve damage.

Most people get enough vitamin B12 from their diet. It is is found in meat, fish, eggs, and milk. It is generally not found in plant foods but many foods have added vitamin B12 such as breakfast cereals. A normal balanced diet usually contains enough vitamin B12. 

The most common cause of vitamin B12 deficiency is pernicious anaemia.  Some problems of the gut can also be a cause of vitamin B12 deficiency, but this is less uncommon, for example:

surgery to remove parts of the bowel (the stomach or the end of the small intestine) 
Crohn's disease 
atrophic gastritis (where the lining of the stomach is thinned).
A deficiency of vitamin B12 can also occur with poor nutrition. Long term strict vegetarian or vegan diets (no animal products) are associated with a higher risk of vitamin B12 deficiency. This is especially important during pregnancy and breastfeeding when more vitamin B12 is needed.

The level of vitamin B12 in the body can be measured by a blood test. If you have low levels of vitamin B12 your doctor may prescribe hydroxocobalamin, which is given as an injection.  

How is hydroxocobalamin given?
Hydroxocobalamin is given as an intramuscular injection, into the buttock muscle.
The usual dose of hydroxocobalamin in people with pernicious anaemia is 1 milligram injected three times a week for two weeks, then once every two to three months.
For people with gut disorders and older adults (over 50 years) who don't get enough vitamin B12 in their diet, hydroxocobalamin is given as twice yearly injections (every 6 months). This can be stopped when vitamin B12 levels have returned to normal and if the diet has improved. Women who are following a vegan diet may also need vitamin B12 injections if they are pregnant or breastfeeding. 
Possible side effects
Like all medicines, hydroxocobalamin can cause side effects, although not everyone gets them. Often side effects improve as your body gets used to the new medicine.  ",,,https://www.immune.org.nz/vaccines/available-vaccines,,,,

The vaccine should be given before the influenza season in New Zealand.

The World Health Organization monitors influenza illness throughout the year and make recommendations on which three influenza types are likely to cause the most illness in the northern and in the southern hemisphere during their respective influenza seasons. Vaccine ingredients are specific to the brand of influenza vaccine they are associated with and may vary to year. Specific information on ingredients in the vaccines use each season can be found on the individual vaccine datasheets.

Influenza immunisation is recommended and offered free to:

Pregnant women (any trimester)
People aged 65 years or older
People aged under 65 years with a medical condition that increases their risk of developing complications from influenza, and the condition is specified in the Influenza Immunisation Programme eligibility criteria.
Children aged 4 years or under who have been hospitalised for respiratory illness or who have a history of significant respiratory illness.
Please note: From 1 April 2019, PHARMAC removed the influenza vaccine eligibility criteria for people under 18 years of age living in Seddon, Kaikoura and Hurunui areas.
The standard eligibility criteria for people aged 6 months to under 18 years continues to apply in these regions.
Healthy children and non-pregnant healthy adults under the age of 65 years can purchase the influenza vaccine through their family doctor.

Some employers fund influenza vaccinations for their employees.","Responses are more common in children not previously exposed to the vaccine or virus than in adults.

(whooping cough). The vaccine is sometimes called dTpa vaccine.
BOOSTRIX is intended for use in children aged 4 years and older and
adults.
Diphtheria, pertussis and tetanus are three life-threatening diseases caused by bacterial infection.
The vaccine works by causing the body to produce its own protection (antibodies) against the
disease.
Diphtheria
Diphtheria is a bacterium that lives in the airways of humans and can also affect the skin.
Generally, the airways become inflamed (swollen) causing severe breathing difficulties and
sometimes suffocation. The bacteria release a toxin (poison) which can cause nerve damage,
heart problems and death. The risk of serious complications and death is greater in the very young
and elderly.
Tetanus (Lockjaw)
Tetanus bacteria enter the body through wounded skin. Wounds that are especially prone to
infection are burn wounds, fractures, deep wounds or wounds contaminated with soil, dust, horse
manure or wood splinters. The bacteria release toxins, which can cause muscle stiffness, painful
spasms, fits and death. The spasm can be strong enough to cause bone fractures of the spine.
Pertussis (Whooping cough)
Pertussis is highly infectious. It affects the breathing tract causing severe spells of coughing
that may interfere with normal breathing. The coughing is often accompanied by a whooping
sound. The cough may last for 1-2 months or longer. Pertussis can also cause inner ear infections,
long lasting bronchitis, pneumonia, fits, brain damage and death. The risk of severe complications
and death is greatest in infants under 6 months of age.
Vaccination is the best way of protecting against these diseases. BOOSTRIX vaccine cannot give
you or your child diphtheria, tetanus or pertussis infection. The vaccine will not protect against
diseases caused by other types of bacteria or organisms.","Pain and swelling around the injection site may prevent normal everyday activities for 2448 hours

GP Codes,,,Twinrix,Twinrix,,,,,,,Hepatitis A & B,Protects against Hepatitis A and B.,"TWINRIX is a combination vaccine used to prevent hepatitis A and hepatitis B infection. The vaccine
works by causing the body to produce its own protection (antibodies) against these diseases.
Hepatitis A and hepatitis B are infectious diseases, which cause the liver to be become inflamed (swollen).
These diseases are caused by viruses - hepatitis A and hepatitis B viruses.
Hepatitis A
Symptoms of hepatitis A usually begin 3 to 6 weeks after coming into contact with the virus. These consist
of nausea (feeling sick), fever, aches and pains. After a few days the skin and/or the whites of the eyes may
become yellowish (jaundice). The severity and type of symptoms can vary. Hepatitis A is often milder in
young children. Most people recover completely but the illness is usually severe enough to keep adults off
work for about a month.
The hepatitis A virus can be passed from person to person in food and drink, or by swimming in water
contaminated by sewage. Hepatitis A is very common in many parts of the world and the risk of infection is
greatest in those areas where hygiene and sanitation are poor. Areas include Asia, India, Africa, Central and
South America, the Pacific Islands, the Middle East, and the Mediterranean Basin. Vaccination is
recommended for travellers to these areas, including people in the armed forces.
Some groups of people however are at a higher risk of exposure to the disease. Vaccination is recommended
for these people:
? nursing staff and healthcare workers in contact with patients in childrens wards, infectious
diseases wards, emergency rooms and intensive care units
? day-care centre staff particularly where children have not been toilet trained
? staff and residents of homes or institutions
? sewerage workers
? food handlers
? homosexual men
? people in contact with an infected person
? people with chronic liver disease or liver transplants, or people who receive certain blood
products.
? some travellers to areas where the incidence of hepatitis A is high
2
Hepatitis B
The hepatitis B virus is found in body fluids such as blood, semen vaginal secretions, or saliva of infected
people. You can catch the virus if it can enter your bloodstream. Ways this can happen are through:
? injection (eg needlestick injury, or sharing needles for IV drug use)
? sexual intercourse
? sores, cuts or tiny wounds coming into contact with infected fluids (eg from a human bite,
sharing razors or toothbrushes, or working with human blood or body fluids)
? an infected mother passing the virus onto her baby during or shortly after birth.
Some people infected with hepatitis B may not look or feel sick yet others will get symptoms. Symptoms
may not appear for 6 weeks to 6 months after infection. Sometimes people will only have mild flu-like
symptoms, but other people can become very ill. They may be extremely tired, and have dark urine, pale
faeces, yellowish skin and/or eyes (jaundice), and other symptoms possibly requiring hospitalisation. There
is a risk of serious liver disease, such as cirrhosis (liver scarring) and liver cancer for all chronic hepatitis B
carriers.
Some groups of people are at a higher risk of exposure to hepatitis B. Vaccination is recommended for these
people:
? some healthcare workers
? abusers of injectable drugs
? people with many sexual partners
? homosexual men
? haemodialysis patients or people who receive certain blood products
? people with chronic liver disease or hepatitis C
? people in contact with a hepatitis B carrier or an infected person
? staff and residents of institutions or homes
? inmates and prison staff at some correctional institutions
? some travellers to areas where the incidence of hepatitis B is high
There is no specific treatment for hepatitis A or hepatitis B. Vaccination is the best way to protect
against infection.
TWINRIX will not protect against hepatitis caused by other agents or viruses (such as hepatitis C or hepatitis
E). If a person is already infected with hepatitis A or hepatitis B virus at the time of vaccination, TWINRIX
may not prevent the disease in these people.
TWINRIX is not recommended for prevention of hepatitis after exposure for example in the case of
needlestick injuries.",,,https://www.medsafe.govt.nz/Consumers/CMI/t/TwinrixAdult.pdf,,,,

GP Codes,,,Under 65 Flu vaccine,Under 65 Flu vaccine,,,,,,Influenza,Influenza (Flu),Protects against some types of influenza.,"Annual influenza immunisation is recommended to provide protection from the predominant circulating influenza strains. The vaccine should be given before the influenza season in New Zealand.

The World Health Organization monitors influenza illness throughout the year and make recommendations on which three influenza types are likely to cause the most illness in the northern and in the southern hemisphere during their respective influenza seasons. Vaccine ingredients are specific to the brand of influenza vaccine they are associated with and may vary to year. Specific information on ingredients in the vaccines use each season can be found on the individual vaccine datasheets.

Influenza immunisation is recommended and offered free to:

Pregnant women (any trimester)
People aged 65 years or older
People aged under 65 years with a medical condition that increases their risk of developing complications from influenza, and the condition is specified in the Influenza Immunisation Programme eligibility criteria.
Children aged 4 years or under who have been hospitalised for respiratory illness or who have a history of significant respiratory illness.
Please note: From 1 April 2019, PHARMAC removed the influenza vaccine eligibility criteria for people under 18 years of age living in Seddon, Kaikoura and Hurunui areas.
The standard eligibility criteria for people aged 6 months to under 18 years continues to apply in these regions.
Healthy children and non-pregnant healthy adults under the age of 65 years can purchase the influenza vaccine through their family doctor.

Some employers fund influenza vaccinations for their employees.","Responses are more common in children not previously exposed to the vaccine or virus than in adults.

Shingles is a painful, blistering rash that may result in scarring. The blisters can persist for
several weeks. They often break out in one part of the body. The nerve pain that comes
from shingles can last for months or even years after the rash heals.
Shingles is caused by the same virus that causes chickenpox. After your chickenpox
blisters heal, the virus that caused them stays in your body in nerve cells. The virus may
be there for many years and not cause a problem. Sometimes, though, it becomes active
again. If this happens, it can cause a blistering and painful rash.
If you do get shingles even though you have been vaccinated, ZOSTAVAX can help
prevent the long-lasting nerve pain that can follow shingles. ZOSTAVAX can also reduce
the intensity and length of time your pain from shingles will last.
